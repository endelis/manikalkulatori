# Autonomous agent journal

Append-only. One dated entry per work cycle, newest at the bottom. New
entries append below the last entry in the file, not below this format
block.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

Did: <what was built/fixed/changed, with file paths>
Learned: <what worked, what didn't, anything that should change future
  priority or approach>
Next: <what the next cycle should pick up>
```

The heading may be a bare date (`## YYYY-MM-DD`) when no meaningful
time is available, optionally followed by a short parenthetical tag
(e.g. `## YYYY-MM-DD (seed)`) — both are acceptable variants of the
same format, not exceptions to it.

A `BLOCKED` entry uses the same format but starts `Did: BLOCKED —` and
states exactly what decision or access is needed from the user.

## 2026-09-10 (seed)

Did: set up this journal and docs/agent/CHARTER.md per
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-10-autonomous-agent-design.md.
Learned: Ahrefs MCP tools are attached but return "Insufficient plan"
on every endpoint including the free domain-rating lookup; no separate
GSC/GA connector exists. Research runs on WebSearch/WebFetch only until
that's revisited.
Next: start Wave 1 (auto/home-energy/endurance-sport, P1 first) per
PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md — check lib/registry.ts against the 50-calculator
list to find the first unbuilt P1 slug.
